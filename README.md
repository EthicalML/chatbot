This basically includes an architectural layer that is in charge of simplifying and standardising data access, making it easier for data scientists and engineers to load and interact with the right datasets. With datasets and data sources growing exponentially, this opportunity will only grow - Alluxio provides a really interesting whitepaper where they explain these challenges, and cover some of the benefits that a platform like alluxio can bring to the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The illustrated transformer                              | http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/                                                                                                                                                   | The Illustrated Transformer Last week we shared Jay’s work on Attention in Seq2seq NLP models.

Everyone in that predicament eventually goes through the logical steps of asking themselves what to do when they have limited supervised data, but lots of unlabeled data, and the literature appears to have a ready answer: semi-supervised learning. This post provides a brief introduction to the concept of semi-supervised machine learning, as well as references to papers that provide an insight on this topic.                                                                       |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

This paper dives into the concept of counterfactuals, which is an ML local model explanation technique that allows you to ask the question “for this ML prediction, what could be the smallest changes I could do to the input to change the outcome?”. Being such a computationally expensive task, this paper proposas a new approach to reduce the computational resources required to use this technique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Flat light: Privacy & Cybersecurity Merging              | http://www.lawfareblog.com/flat-light-data-protection-disoriented-policy-practice                                                                                                                    | Privacy & Cybersecurity Merging One of the most interesting white papers so far, written by Immuta’s Chief Privacy Officer Andrew Burt.

Data streaming is truly driving the way for real-time machine learning usecases. This is also a very interesting project, primarily as it doesn’t aim to replace OSS projects like Kafka, instead it sits on a higher level providing a primary solution for streaming across various stores and messaging systems (Kafka, Azure Events Hub, Kinesis, etc). In this post, they showcase how Brooklyn can be used as a streaming bridge across these heterogeneous messaging services, as well as mirroring kafka functionality, and beyond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Tensorflow AI interpretability                           | http://blog.sicara.com/tf-explain-interpretability-tensorflow-2-9438b5846e35?gi=6a3bde675a49                                                                                                                   | Tensorflow AI Interpretability The tensorflow team enters the ML model interpretability arena with TFExplain - a library that offers interpretability methods to understand model predictions.

This interesting article proposes that adversarial images aren’t 100% a problem—they’re an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with AI. This is an interesting space, as some of the work we have been doing has provided some correlations around explainability/interpretability techniques in AI, and adversarial attacks, where the ultimate objective is to reverse-engineer models (with different ultimate outcomes of course).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Python-compatible spreadsheets for data science    | http://hackernoon.com/introducing-grid-studio-a-spreadsheet-app-with-python-to-make-data-science-easier-tdup38f7                                                | Python-compatible spreadsheets An engineer approach into a data science challenge - Rick Lamers has built a python-first open source spreadsheet application.

Counterfactuals is an incredibly interesting technique that falls within the causal inference family. This technique has been growing in popularity especially due to its intuitive explanatory power. From a high level definition, a counterfactual asks the question around “what would be the minimum change that I could make to change the outcome”. In machine learning this has great predictive power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Neural Network Search AutoML                          | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning#neural-architecture-search        | OSS: NN Architecture AutoML The theme for this week’s featured ML libraries is Neural Network Architecture AutoML, which you can find in our Production Machine Learning ecosystem list.

Whilst a lot of articles that we reference focus on the productionisation techniques and hence “DevOps for ML”, the keyword of AIOps is growingly used to refer to applying ML to DevOps. Key examples of this would be to leverage concept drif, outlier detection, explanations and beyond. Although there is still ambiguity with these terms and concepts, here the new stack provides a deep dive on these increasingly discussed topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Language models as knowledge bases                       | https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066                                                                                                                                                                     | Lang models as knowledge bases Interesting perspective on how the potential of languge models can be generalised. In this paper, the authors argue that language models may also be storing relational knowledge present in the training data, and may be able to answer queries structured as “fill-in-the-blank” cloze statements. They suggest that language models have advantages over structured knowledge bases, and they propose the “LAMA (LAnguage Model Anal-ysis) probe” to test the factual and commonsenseknowledge in language models. They have also made their code available open source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | AWS Data Security best practices                          | http://datafloq.com/read/best-practices-for-data-security-in-aws/6804                                                                                                   | AWS data security best practices In AI data is key, and with growing usecases it’s key to ensure your security is aligned with best practices.

Google already has a numerous set of data processing engines including Dremel, Mesa, Photon , F1, PowerDrill and Spanner - so, why did they need yet another data processing engine? Apparently because they felt they had too many data processing systems, and wanted to unify them all. Because of this, Google released a fascinating new paper that introduces their new SQL Engine called Porcella, which aims to unify serving and analytical data at youtube. This blog post provides a great insight on the architecture, objectives and use-cases of this new engine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Tackling data processing at scale with Presto foundation | https://www.linuxfoundation.org/uncategorized/2019/09/facebook-uber-twitter-and-alibaba-form-presto-foundation-to-tackle-distributed-data-processing-at-scale/                                                 | Tackling data processing at scale The Linux Foundation is leading yet another fantastic initiative: Facebook, Uber, Twitter and Alibaba join forces to form the “Presto Foundation” to tackle distributed data processing at scale.

This initiative is incredibly exciting, because it has several tech leaders collaborating on defining what production ML could look like, and working towards abstracting some of very complex and heterogeneous production ML terminology, into standardised protocols and interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | When a model is to big for production                    | http://nlathia.github.io/2019/09/29/Large-NLP-in-prod/                                                                                                                                                         | When a model is too big for prod Machine learning models that are trained with very large datasets introduce new complexities, including large memory usage, heavy compute, black box constraints and more.

However the lack of resources around the social challenges which ML practitioners may face is not significant. Three researchers from Cornell, Berkeley and Princeton came together to write a non-exhaustive but comprehensible book that contains key insights to consider “Fairness” as core throughout the development of ML-related systems, as opposed to as an afterthought. The book is still work in progress, but there are a couple of key chapters available for free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | AI ethics - whose ethics?                          | http://www.meetup.com/Ethics-Lunch-Group-Rise-London/events/265585657/                                                                                          | AI Ethics - whose ethics? As AI becomes more prevalent in society, we face thougher challenges around privacy, security and trust of systems. These challenges often create scenarios that may raise ethical questions which practitioners and leaders will have to tackle. Because of this, learning and studying the underlying philosophical concepts that have been built throughout the millenia could provide incredibly positive results. We started a lunch group in London to dive into these topics once a month. Last session Dr. Ryan Dawson provided in introducion on Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics, which followed by a discussion around their relevance in today’s connected world. Next session’s topic is “Whose Ethics?” where we’ll be diving into the  similarities and differences of Western and Eastern philosophy and its modern relevance into AI Ethics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Machine learning deployment & orchestration libraries | https://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                  | IEML joins the Linux Foundation The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning (the non-profit behind this newsletter) is thrilled to be joining the Linux Foundation’s LFAI as an organisational member!

One of the key challenges is to manage a large number of machine learning models, potentially from various users, and being able to compare them and upgrade them into staging and production environments. Dataricks announced a new ML Management feature which tackles this issue by providing a workflow system to version and manage models across multiple stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Choosing charts that everyone understands                | http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/choose-charts-everyone-understands/                                                                                                                               | Choosing intuitive visualisations When dealing with challenges that involve a lot of data, it’s often hard to choose the best visualisations to use at different stages of the project.

The paper proposes a weakly-supervised, model-based approach for verifying factual consistency and identifying conflicts between source documents and a generated summary. This proposed approach verifies three key things: 1) identify whether sentences remain factually consistent after transformation, 2) extract a span in the source documents to support the consistency prediction, 3) extract a span in the summary sentence that is inconsistent if one exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Linux Foundation Trusted AI                               | http://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/10/29/trusted-ai-committee-established/                                                                                                | Linux Foundation Trusted AI LF AI is an umbrella foundation of the Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

As AI becomes more prevalent in society, we face thougher challenges around privacy, security and trust of systems. These challenges often create scenarios that may raise ethical questions which practitioners and leaders will have to tackle. Because of this, learning and studying the underlying philosophical concepts that have been built throughout the millenia could provide incredibly positive results. We started a lunch group in London to dive into these topics once a month. Last session Dr. Ryan Dawson provided in introducion on Aristotle’s Nichomachean Ethics, which followed by a discussion around their relevance in today’s connected world. Next session’s topic is “Whose Ethics?” where we’ll be diving into the similarities and differences of Western and Eastern philosophy and its modern relevance into AI Ethics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                  | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                   | OSS: Data Science Notebooks   The theme for this week’s featured ML libraries is Data Science Notebooks, and we’re happy to share brand new libraries into that section to showcase tools beyond the good old Jupyter Notebooks.

Technology applications like this can be incredibly interestibg, but also require an evaluation of its impact in society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Scalble AutoML with Ray on Spark                         | https://medium.com/riselab/scalable-automl-for-time-series-prediction-using-ray-and-analytics-zoo-b79a6fd08139                                                                                       | Scalable AutoML with Ray Machine learning experimentation can be highly time consuming, and with growing complexity of machine learning requirements make it harder to build and run experimentation at scale. The team at Intel have put together a great insight on how they are tackling it with their “analytics zoo”, and more specifically in this post they outline how it can be tackled leveraging AutoML using Ray on top of Spark. This is an interesting approach as it allows the technical user to leverage existing Spark infrastructure, but with the simplicity of Ray, which in this case allows for large scale automated hyperparameter search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Tensorflow world videos are now out                       | http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxcmHHRftsuiO1GyinVAwUg                                                                                                 | Tensorflow World Videos O’Reilly and TensorFlow teamed up to put together the first TensorFlow World conference, which took place recently.

However this can lead to a lot of false positives being flagged, creating too much noise, which could lead into ignoring these alerts (And real issues not being caught). The Seldon team has released a new open source machine learning library that focuses on outlier, adversarial and concept drift detection, which allows for smarter monitoring techniques. The package aims to cover both online and offline detectors for tabular data, text, images and time series. This package is built with production machine learning use-cases in mind, and has continuously updated integrations with the ML deployment framework Seldon Core.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The AI Governance Dilemma                                | https://hackernoon.com/move-fast-and-break-things-the-ai-governance-dilemma-dsq32ix                                                                                                                            | The AI Governance Dilemma As machine learning is adopted in more critical use-cases, the common phrase that tech startups have used “move fast and break things” becomes less desired. In this great article by Seldon Open Source Engineer Ryan Dawston, breaks down this AI Governance Dilemma. Ryan provides an introduction to the challenges of ML being deployed in critical use-cases, together with the different areas that should be taken into account, including outliers, concept drift, bias, privacy and other risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mening-aware word vectors with sense2vec                 | http://explosion.ai/blog/sense2vec-reloaded                                                                                                                                                          | Contextually Keyed Word Vectors Neural word representations have proven useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to efficiently model complex semantic and syntactic word relationships. However, most techniques model only one representation per word, despite the fact that a single word can have multiple meanings or “senses”. The ExplosionAI team, which is also behind SpaCy created a technique which they called sense2vec, which builds word embeddings in a similar way to word2vec, but also takes into account part-of-speech attributes for word tokens, which allow for meaning-aware vectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Time series anomaly detection at Microsoft                | http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03821                                                                                                                                         | Time Series Anomaly Detection Large companies need to monitor various metrics of their applications and services in realtime. Microsoft has released a fascinating paper where they share some of their knowledge developing and maintaining a time-series anomaly detection service which helps customers to monitor the time-series continuously and alert for potential incidents on time. In this paper, they introduce the pipeline and algorithm of their anomaly detection service,which is designed to be accurate, efficient and general. The pipeline consists of three major modules, including data ingestion, exper-imentation platform and online compute. In this paper, the team also proposes a novel algorithmbased on Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Pyro 1.0 Released with LFAI                        | http://lfai.foundation/blog/2019/11/18/pyro-1-0-has-arrived/                                                                                                    | Pyro 1.0 Released Another great announcement from the LFAI this week - Pyro has released it’s 1.0 version!

That way, in case of high uncertainty, we can perform more extensive tests or pass the case to a human in order to avoid potentially wrong results.

More users and more features led to more systems that relied on Machine Learning to scale inferences across a growing user base. As these ML systems were buildt, they started to hit a point where engineers spent more of their time maintaining data and backend systems in support of the ML-specific code than iterating on the model itself. They realized we needed to standardize best practices and build tooling to bridge the gaps between data, backend, and ML. This blog post outlines their experience building just that, and how they leverage Tensorflow Extended (TFX) and Kubeflow in their Paved Road for ML systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                  | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                   | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

However, in recent years, a shift in research direction and new tools such as soft-attention and progress in deep reinforcement learning are opening the door to the development of novel deep architectures and training frameworks for addressing System 2 tasks (which are done consciously), such as reasoning, planning, capturing causality and obtaining systematic generalization in natural language processing and other applications. Yoshua Bengio shared very interesting insights on this NeurIPS talk which covered the key concepts that will enable expansion from System 1 tasks to System 2 tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The Artificial Intelligence Index 2019 Report            | http://hai.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10986/f/ai_index_2019_report.pdf                                                                                                                                   | AI Index 2019 Report The AI Index, a Stanford-backed initiative to assess the progress and impact of AI, has launched its 2019 report.

The language model GPT-2 from OpenAI is one of the most coherent generative models for text out there. While its generation capabilities are impressive, it’s ability to zero-shot perform some of the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks seems even more fascinating to Rakesh. In this blog post, some of those capabilities are highlighted as well as a deep dive on one such fun use-case of converting singular nouns in english to their plural counterparts (and vice-versa).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Open Source Business Models                        | http://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/                                                                                                         | Open Source Business Models The open source software (OSS) movement has created some of our most important and widely used technologies, including operating systems, web browsers, databases and (of course) machine learning. Our world would not function, or at least not function as well, without open source software. In this podcast, Peter Levene shares some of his experience working with open source as a developer, entrepreneur and investor around business models for open source projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                  | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                   | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

Furthermore in the context of organisations holding data, this data has both a value and a risk that is currently ambiguous to quantify. This artcle discusses methods proposed in Bekeley papers that attempt to answer this question in the ML context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Intro to Ethics in Artificial Intelligence                | http://www.meetup.com/Ethics-Lunch-Group-Rise-London/events/267303953/                                                                                                  | Intro to Ethics in AI The discussion of ethics in AI has become more critical as more applications make their way into production environments that affect the real world.

The reason is that many machine learning algorithms are designed to operate on classification data with an equal number of observations for each class. When this is not the case, algorithms can learn that very few examples are not important and can be ignored in order to achieve good performance. In this article, machine learning mastery dives into a set of practical sampling methods that can be used when facing imbalanced datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                  | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                   | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

These tasks are often prone to failures, and retrying mechanisms often make it even more expensive to operate applications with such jobs. Having a background queue helps the web servers handle incoming web requests promptly, and reduces the likelihood of performance issues that occur when requests become backlogged. At Airbnb, they built a job scheduling system called Dynein for very critical use cases. In this article, they walk through the history of job queuing systems at Airbnb, explain why they built Dynein, and describe how they were able to achieve its high scalability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Confidence models in financial research & practice | http://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-trinity-of-errors-in-applying-confidence-intervals-an-exploration-using-statsmodels                                            | Applying confidence models Financial models are at the mercy in model specifications, errors in model parameter estimates and errors resulting from the failure of a model to adapt to structural changes of an environment. Because of this trifecta of errors, it’s important for dynamic models to quanitfy the uncertainty inherent in the financial estimates and predictions. This post they explore three types of errors in applying confidence intervals that are common in financial research and practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                  | http://github.com/ethicalml/awesome-production-machine-learning                                   | Featured OSS Production ML Libraries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

These include the Training, Validation, Testing, Serving and Monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Explaining Long Term ML Impact                           | http://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/ml-fairness-gym-tool-for-exploring-long.html                                                                                                                        | Explaining Long Term ML Impact Machine learning systems have been increasingly deployed to aid in high-impact decision-making, such as determining criminal sentencing, child welfare assessments, who receives medical attention and many other settings. Understanding whether such systems are fair is crucial, and requires an understanding of models’ short- and long-term effects.Google released a research paper which outlines a set of components for building simple simulations that explore potential long-run impacts of deploying machine learning-based decision systems in social environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Quantifying Reproducibility of ML                         | http://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/                                                                                                     | Quantifying Reproducibility of ML Peer review has been an integral part of scientific research for more than 300 years. But even before peer review was introduced, reproducibility was a primary component of the scientific method. Now, we hear warnings that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) face their own reproducibility crises. This article dives into insights obtained whilst attempting to reproduce ML algorithms from papers continuously, leading into a framework to assess and quantify how reproducible a specific resource is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Adversarial Examples Resource                      | http://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html                                                                                    | Adversarial Examples Resource It can be hard to stay up-to-date on the published papers in the field of adversarial examples, where we have seen massive growth in the number of papers written each year.

This method is a member of the additive feature attribution methods class; feature attribution refers to the fact that the change of an outcome to be explained (e.g., a class probability in a classification problem) with respect to a baseline (e.g., average prediction probability for that class in the training set) can be attributed in different proportions to the model input features. The Alibi Explain OSS project has implemented this technique and has put together several jupyter notebook examples to implement this algorithm across various models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | AI meets operations with OReilly                   | http://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-meets-operations/                                                                                                               | AI meets operations with OReilly One of the biggest challenges operations groups will face over the coming year will be learning how to support AI- and ML-based applications.

It’s key to be able to understand the performance, and especially the degrades that the models experience as time passes. Whether it is due to data distribution changing, or other external factors, it’s key to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.

Sometimes you have benchmarked it and want to know how close you are to the maximum speed. Often you just need to know what the current limiting factor is, to guide your optimization decisions.

This research paper unifies eight popular post hoc explanation methods, showing that they all perform local function approximation of a black-box model. This not only advances our understanding of these methods, but also provides a guiding principle for choosing among them in practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Annual Year in Review and Tech Predictions            | https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-annual-reviews-and-trends                                    | 2022-2023 Reviews & Predictions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

This class covers algorithms to find and fix common issues in ML data and to construct better datasets, concentrating on data used in supervised learning tasks like classification. All material taught in this course is highly practical, focused on impactful aspects of real-world ML applications, rather than mathematical details of how particular models work. You can take this course to learn practical techniques not covered in most ML classes, which will help mitigate the “garbage in, garbage out” problem that plagues many real-world ML applications. Videos are available on Youtube, together with the respective course materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | MAD: ML, AI & Data Landscape                             | http://mattturck.com/mad2023/                                                                                                                                                                        | MAD: ML, AI & Data Landscape The 2023 MAD (Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence & Data) Landscape has now been released 😈 The MAD landscape is now an annualy-released resource covering the AI/ML landscape, together with market trends, trends in data infrastructure and trends in general ML & AI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Curated List on Applied ML                                | http://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml                                                                                                                                  | Curated List on Applied ML Applied ML Repo (23k+ ⭐) A fantastic resource containing curated papers, articles and blogs on data science and machine learning in production.

In this resource we take a relatively amusing approach, where we deploy a ML Pipeline with a GPT model as the pre-processor and a text-to-image GenAI model as the post-processor. This allowed for a “creative” workflow where images are created from a single word, into a generated phrase, into an image.

The training process involves four major stages: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning. He highlights the importance of tokenization during pre-training and discusses ‘constraint prompting’ for controlling LLM outputs. He also touches upon the practice of model fine-tuning, suggesting the use of techniques like LoRA, while warning against the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Karpathy recommends using detailed prompts and experimenting with tools to optimize LLM use. Despite their limitations, such as bias and susceptibility to attacks, he views LLMs as valuable co-pilots in low-stake applications, while expressing admiration for the breadth of knowledge encapsulated by models like GPT-4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2023 State of AI from Databricks                         | https://www.databricks.com/discover/state-of-data-ai                                                                                                                                                 | 2023 State of AI from Databricks The 2023 State of Data + AI report examines trends in data and AI based on data from over 9,000 global Databricks customers.

In 2021, researchers identified a “grokking” phenomenon where certain machine learning models transition from memorizing to generalizing after extended training. Using modular addition and binary sequences as test cases, this study reveal that the occurrence of grokking is contingent on specific hyperparameters like weight decay. While observed in smaller models, there’s evidence to suggest that larger models might also exhibit grokking.

This is an interesting development similar to the TSMixer architecture that Google released a few months ago. This “iTransformer” architecture leverages an inverted which instead of treating each time step as a token, it embeds the entire variable history as individual tokens, addressing the typical Transformer limitations in this domain.

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), a non-invasive technique, they have developed an AI system that can decode and reconstruct images from brain activity in real-time. This system comprises three parts: an image encoder, a brain encoder, and an image decoder. When trained on a public dataset, the system showed that modern AI models, especially self-supervised ones like DINOv2, align well with brain signals, suggesting that these AI models learn representations similar to how the brain does. While the reconstructed images from MEG are not as precise as those from fMRI, a more spatially accurate but slower technique, they capture high-level features of the original images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Every Dev Should Know on GPUs                            | http://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/gpu-computing                                                                                                                                                            | Every Dev Should Know on GPUs What Every Developer Should Know About GPU Computing: GPUs are designed for massive parallelism and high throughput, this article delves into key GPU concepts such as architecture, streaming multiprocessors, memory hierarchies, and CUDA.

This early ranker, which uses only about 5% of the compute cost per item compared to the final ranker, is trained through “Knowledge Distillation” to closely mimic the final ranker’s decisions, rather than just learning from user actions. This approach addresses alignment issues between the early and final rankers, ensuring more effective and cost-efficient filtering of candidates for final ranking. The article suggests two methods for knowledge distillation and refers to further in-depth resources for interested practitioners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

The machine learning field is considered ‘hard’ not only due to the scientific concepts involved, but due to the complexity in the workflows involved in the ML lifecycle, together with the intuition needed to select appropriate models and algorithms. Debugging in ML is uniquely challenging as it involves four dimensions: algorithm, implementation, data, and the model itself, making it more complex than traditional software debugging. This complexity is compounded by long feedback loops in training models, necessitating parallel experimentation and hindering sequential knowledge building. The core skill in ML, therefore, lies in developing an intuition for diagnosing and solving problems across these multiple dimensions, a skill honed through continuous practice and experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Hand-picked AI Fundamentals                               | https://aman.ai/primers/ai/                                                                                                                                             | An extensive and comprehensive hand-picked list of AI Fundamentals: The article provides a comprehensive guide for machine learning practitioners, encompassing a wide array of topics crucial to AI and ML.

The EU Cyber Resilience Act has raised concerns within the open source community regarding its impact on software development, testing, auditing, and support. However since its first inception, this policy has adopted feedback from the community, now explicitly targets commercial activities, exempting non-commercial open source projects and contributors from its regulations. It specifies conditions under which open source could be considered commercial, thereby subject to the CRA, and introduces a “light-touch” regulatory regime for open-source software stewards supporting commercial use. While the CRA does not directly regulate most open source software, it mandates due diligence from commercial users, potentially benefiting open source security. Production machine learning practitioners engaged in commercial open source activities should be aware of this new policy, which will most likely influence the security practices within the open source machine learning ecosystem.                   | Stanford’s Modern Algorithms                              | https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/index.html                                                                                                                         | Stanford is providing a refresher of the traditional computer science course on “Data Structures and Algorithms” focusing on the Modern Algorithmic Toolbox: Stanford has ran a course in Spring 2023 focusing on the core algorithms that power modern machine learning and data analysis.

She covers the concept of measuring personal growth using unique metrics beyond conventional means like net worth or social media followers. There are three main heuristics for personal development presented: the rate of change in identity every 3-6 years, the efficiency in solving life’s significant problems such as career, family, and finance, and the number of future options available, akin to empowerment maximization principles used in reinforcement learning. Great advice on focusing on novelty and exploration, suggesting that personal growth can be quantified by one’s ability to become a different person, resolve major life challenges quickly, and maximize potential future opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

The key strategy involves aligning technical debt with business goals by demonstrating how it impacts developer velocity, time to market, customer experience, and long-term scalability. The guide offers a five-step process: understanding the business strategy, quantifying the problem with metrics, linking technical debt to business outcomes, proposing a phased solution, and presenting the proposal empathetically in a format the PMs can easily understand. By framing technical debt as a value proposition, engineers can better advocate for its prioritization alongside new features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

This study was conducted at Microsoft, Accenture, and an anonymous company - the study evaluates the effect of Copilot on metrics such as pull requests, commits, and successful builds (indeed not optimal metrics but still relevant insights). The results show that Copilot increases developer productivity by approximately 26%, with a particularly strong effect on the number of pull requests and builds. Junior and short-tenure developers exhibited higher adoption rates and saw the most significant productivity gains. However, the effects were not consistently statistically significant across all metrics or companies - this is obviously key, but it’s great to see investments towards quantifying the causal impact of AI tools in development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Explicit is Better than Implicit                   | https://www.trevorlasn.com/blog/-explicit-is-better-than-implicit/                                                                                              | One of the age-old lessons on clean-code: the importance of writing explicit, clear code over implicit, ambiguous code in software development.

Implicit code can introduce confusion and increase the cognitive load for developers, leading to higher “WTF per Minute” (WTFPM) rates - indeed a great standardised quantifiable metric across industry (!).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Upcoming events on Production ML                      | https://ethical.institute                                                                         | ­ ­                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

This new release seems to introduce a different approach over previous models like GPT-4o, which is now specialising on benchmarks for mathematics and science expertise, and programming competence. In practice there has been a broad range of mixed responses, but there seems to be a strong claim for this approach to have some strong potential for improving safety and alignment by allowing the model to internally reason about safety rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Copilot is making Devs Worse                             | https://www.darrenhorrocks.co.uk/why-copilot-making-programmers-worse-at-programming/                                                                                                                | Copilot is Making Programmers Worse at Programming: AI code-generation tools like GitHub Copilot have potential to improve productivity, however they can also be double-edged sword which may worsen programmers’ fundamental skills by introducing over-reliance on auto-generated code.

Increased efficiency can paradoxically worsen outcomes, which is a phenomenon termed by the strong version of Goodhart’s Law, which is compared to the concept of overfitting in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when an ML model over-optimizes a specific dataset instead of the generalised distribution expected to be seen in the real world. It is possible to mitigate these isuses by better aligning proxy objectives with true goals, introducing regularization penalties, injecting noise, applying early stopping, and adjusting system capacities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Google Measuring Dev Goals                               | https://research.google/pubs/measuring-developer-goals/                                                                                                                                              | Google on Measuring Machine Learning Productivity Goals across organisations: A great paper from Google’s Developer Productivity team on the importance of understanding and measuring overarching developer goals to enhance productivity and experience, especially in complex, iterative workflows common in production machine learning.

Extraneous cognitive load, caused by overly complex conditionals, excessive small modules or microservices, and unnecessary abstractions, can be reduced by simplifying code, favoring deep modules with simple interfaces, and using language features sparingly.

The vector search functionality is built upon Microsoft Research’s SPANN and SPFresh algorithms, which in themselves deserve their own deep dive, as they have enabled integration into MySQL’s default storage engine (InnoDB); this means that inserts, updates, and deletes of vector data are immediately reflected in the vector index as part of SQL transactions, ensuring ACID compliance. This is quite an interesting advancement, as we are able to see the foundational DB field and emerging technologies converge to ensure standardisation and best practice to simplify architecture and operations while leveraging familiar SQL features.         | Google Shopping 10m Embedding                             | https://github.com/marqo-ai/GCL                                                                                                                                         | Vector Embedding Platform Marco has released a Google Shopping Dataset with 10m products for benchmarking of multi-modal ranking evaluation, together with a new approach to improve multi-modal retrieval and ranking. This is quite an interesting deep dive into their “Generalized Contrastive Learning” framework for optimization of retrieval and ranking by encoding multiple data types (like text and images) and incorporating fine-grained relevance directly into embeddings. From the research they share, it seems this framework extends CLIP-style models to improve multi-modal retrieval and ranking whilst addressing limitations of existing approaches through unified representations of documents composed of multiple fields, enhancing intra-modal understanding, and optimizing embeddings for efficient storage in vector databases. It is great to see initiatives that bring together novel approaches together with benchmarking frameworks that encourage further breakthroughs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | META Llama LLM Optimisation                        | https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-quantized-lightweight-models/                                                                                               | Efficiency in LLMs is becoming growingly important; Meta has now released quantized versions of its Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models optimized for mobile devices which they suggest up to 4× speedup + 56% reduction in model size + 41% less memory usage compared to the original models: This is quite an interesting approach using QLoRA + post-training quantization method which doesn’t require the original training data. It is quite insightful to see that the race to larger accurate models is almost marching the race to smaller accurate models!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

Insightful results from our survey on the State of Prod ML in 2024; it seems that although the area of ML model training is one of the most consolidated areas in regards to tooling, there is still quite a significant percentage of organisations that do not use an off-the-shelf framework and build custom in-house tools for their ML Training. Not surprisingly it does seem like the main choices are the cloud providers, however with quite a large gap between Azure/Google vs AWS/Databricks. If you have a chance we would be grateful if you could spend a few minutes on the survey, as you’ll contribute valuable information about the machine learning tools and platforms you use in your production ML development.

TimescaleDB proposes treating embeddings as derived data similar to database indexes, which is interesting given recent extensions from DBs like planetscale to integrate embeddings natively into indexes, similarly through a “native vectorizer” abstraction. In this case however they still leverage the OSS pgai Vectorizer for PostgreSQL which helps automating the synchronization of embeddings with their source data within the database, however this does provide an insight on some of the open challenges that are yet to be addressed, and perhaps also one of the reasons why we still see lack of standardisation on VectorDBs in the State of Prod ML 2024 Survey. | Embeddings are Underrated                                 | https://technicalwriting.dev/data/embeddings.html                                                                                                                       | Although many may claim that LLMs and GenAI are driving the current AI revolution, there is a strong reason to believe that one of the biggest breakthroughs and drivers are the innovations within embeddings, implemented beyond just text: Vector embeddings have grown to become a hugely powerful tool in ML, not only powering the GenAI / LLM products that have been blowing minds recently, but also powering things like product recommendations, similarity search and beyond. This is a great intuitive overview of embeddings with a few practical examples that can provide a high level conceptual understanding for individuals that may not have come across some of these internals - there are other interesting applications, such as how AirBNB used embeddings for similar listing recommendations all the way back in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | GPT-4o Data Poisoning                              | https://far.ai/post/2024-10-poisoning/                                                                                                                          | One of the most pressing challenges when deploying GenAI products is ensuring robust guardrails are in place - companies are investing heavily on increasing the safety of their products, but data poisoning and jailbreaking attacks keep advancing at a faster pace, and here is a great example: Even advanced and robust GenAI powered products like GPT-4o are suceptible to security vulnerabilities - this is a great example showcasing data poisoning and a potent new attack called “jailbreak-tuning,” where attackers inject harmful behaviors by fine-tuning models on poisoned datasets, even when advanced moderation systems are in place. This is a great deep dive into three threat models, including 1) malicious fine-tuning, 2) imperfect data curation, and 3) intentional data contamination, which really make it clear that that larger models become more susceptible to these attacks as they scale. This also makes it clear that it only continues to become more critical to ensure robust evaluation metrics, fine-tuning safeguards, and ongoing stress-testing to prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities in production environments - this means that organisations also have to invest into their existing security / red-teaming capabilities to support this. |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

Over time, this scaling principle was validated far beyond translation, culminating in today’s GPT-style models. However, it seems we are exhausting the “fossil fuel” of internet-scale data, and future progress will hinge on new techniques - eg. agents interacting with their environments, generating synthetic data, and improved reasoning capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Google Releasing Gemini 2.0                              | https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/                                                                                                                          | Google drops the mic last week releasing Gemini 2.0 with a bunch of new features on their AI studio, doubling down towards “agentic” AI with multimodal input/output: As expected Google is building on the initial Gemini 1.x foundation, extending long-context and multimodality capabilities, improves latency and performance, and introducing features like native image and audio generation. Something that comes across as novel is the integration into Google’s products and ecosystem, however the race continues to move at breakneck speed so we can only expect similar pace from the tech ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Tiktok’s Recommendation System                           | https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07663                                                                                                                                                                     | Tiktok has published the architecture behind their recommendation system called “Monolith”, a real-time massive-scale recommendation system designed specifically to address production challenges such as large-scale, sparse, and dynamic feature spaces: The paper provides interesting insights such as collisionless embedding table based on Cuckoo hashing, which enables dynamic inclusion and eviction of new model features.

They’ve also introduced Flow Matching, a hierarchical byte-level tokenizer-free approach (Dynamic Byte Latent Transformer) for generative modeling. Additionally, they released a new version of Meta CLIP, which improves on previous versions for vision-language alignment.

As per the usual naming convention, this comes with Sora Turbo, focusing on fast generation of higher fidelity videos across multiple aspect ratios, and up to 20-second. These services continue to surprise us with the quality of the video generation, certainly still with quite some limitations (such as many posts showing the limits when rendering scenes from gymnastics, etc). The model is still imperfect, struggling with complex sequences and realistic physics - however it is great to see finally OpenAI is releasing to encourage community input and iteration norm-setting, and responsible use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |

Surprisingly, GPT‑4o tended to revert to “mutual defection”, and Gemini 1.5 showed only “weak gains”. It seems like there is a growing number of similar studies around LLMs for simulations of specific environments, which provide interesting sandboxes to test human-like interactions between actors at scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Google’s Globally Distributed DB                         | https://research.google/pubs/spanner-googles-globally-distributed-database-2/                                                                                                                        | An excellent paper for MLOps and Machine Learning Engineering practitioners is the classic Google’s Spanner paper: Google proposed an interesting globally distributed database architecture which offers strong external consistency at the cost of slight latency increase. The paper dives into how it integrates a two-phase commit with Paxos replication to automatically shard data and ensure high availability with lock-free snapshot reads. This commit wait is what introduces the design trade-off of slightly increased write latency (e.g., “commit wait”), but it is also what delivers synchronous replication and globally consistent reads, which is particularly useful for example in large-scale machine learning and MLOps systems requiring reproducible data snapshots, as well as the ability to evolve data schemas and indexes without downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Gentle Intro to Graph Neural Networks                     | https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/                                                                                                                                     | This is one of the best visual/intuitive introductions to Graph Neural Networks out there! As a reminder on GNNs, these graph neural networks are able to generalize deep learning by handling entities as nodes and their relationships as edges. This enables “passing messages” between connected nodes to learn context-aware representations that can power node-, edge-, or graph-level predictions. There are some nuances when working with GNNs vs traditional NNs, such as key design choices on how to represent nodes/edges, how to aggregate local or global information (e.g., via sum, mean, or max pooling), and how many layers to stack for broader context. GNNs are certainly worth learning, as a lot of real-world applications we see these relationships, and we have shown success in varied domains such as social networks, molecule property prediction, recommendation systems, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | An Evolved Transformer Memory                      | https://sakana.ai/namm/                                                                                                                                         | OpenAI O1’s impressive performance at high compute ($3k est. per task) highlights that performance is the next tech race - Japanese startup Sakana AI brings a new approach to reduce memory by 75% with improved inference: Sakana AI releases this new “universal transformer memory” technique which uses small neural “attention memory” modules (NAMMs) to dynamically decide which tokens to keep or discard within an LLM’s context window. This sounds like quite a simple technique, but it promises to potentially cut memory usage by up to 75%. This is ceratinly going to be an interesting space to watch throughout 2025 and beyond!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                       |                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                      |                                                                 |                                      |
