Really interesting insights from 2024, including highlights on the performance gap between proprietary models like GPT-4 and open-source alternatives has narrowed significantly, with advancements in planning, reasoning, and multimodal capabilities extending AI’s applications into fields like mathematics, biology, and neuroscience. One interesting observation is that despite U.S. sanctions, Chinese labs continue to produce competitive AI models through alternative means. Similarly, the economic impact of global AI has surged, with public companies reaching a combined enterprise value of $9 trillion, although questions about long-term sustainability and viable business models remain.
