      "<p>Databases in 2023: A Year in Review (with AI at the helm!) 💡 In 2023, the database industry was marked by the rise of vector databases, fueled by the growing interest in Large Language Models like ChatGPT, which revolutionized semantic search in unstructured data. This trend led to rapid adoption by various DBMS vendors and significant venture capital investment. Concurrently, SQL continued to evolve with the SQL:2023 specification, enhancing graph-structured queries and array data handling. The industry also faced challenges, exemplified by MariaDB Corporation’s struggles and the FAA’s NOTAM system outage, underscoring the risks of legacy systems. Oracle (under Larry Ellison) achieved significant milestones, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the database sector, increasingly influenced by AI and ML technologies.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/audio2photoreal\">Meta’s Audio2Animation AI Model</a></p>\n",
      "<p>Meta’s new Audio-to-3D-Animation AI model with open source code, pretrained models and datasets: An insightufl new research project from Meta Research which presents a framework for generating photorealistic, full-bodied human avatars from audio inputs, focusing on conversational gestures. They have also made available an OSS PyTorch implementation, including training and testing code, pretrained models, and a specialized dataset. The paper highlights the use of vector quantization and diffusion processes to create dynamic and expressive avatar motions, outperforming existing methods. This work is significant for applications in general computer animated interactions, which for meta seems to continue on their Metaverse quest.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/DLYuanGod/TinyGPT-V\">Efficient Multimodal OSS LLMs</a></p>\n",
      "<p>TinyGPT-V brings us an exciting step forward towards high-performance LLMs that can run in modest hardware: TinyGPT-V is an innovative multimodal large language model designed for efficient performance on commodity hardware, requiring only a 24G GPU for training and an 8G GPU or CPU for inference. Both the code and the model have now been open sourced, which were built upon the Phi-2 architecture and integrate pre-trained vision modules, boasting 2.8 billion parameters. It stands out for its unique quantization process, making it suitable for various devices including devices with limited memory. TinyGPT-V represents a breakthrough in making advanced MLLMs accessible for a broader range of applications, significantly reducing the computational resources required for high-level multimodal learning tasks.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04615\">Deep Learning on Relational DBs</a></p>\n",
      "<p>Introducing Deep Learning for Relational Database Data Structures and Graph Relationships: Relational Deep Learning is a groundbreaking approach introduced for efficiently utilizing data from relational databases in machine learning. This method treats databases as heterogeneous graphs, where rows are nodes and primary-foreign key relations are edges, enabling the use of Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for direct learning from multi-table data without manual feature engineering. RDL enhances model accuracy and reduces data preparation time, representing a significant advancement for practitioners dealing with complex, relational datasets. The paper also introduces RelBench, a set of diverse benchmark datasets and an RDL implementation framework, marking a new direction in graph machine learning research applicable to a wide array of AI use cases.</p>\n",

This article highlights 10\\npython machine learning libraries that came out in 2019 which are must\\nwatch, many of the libraries in the list which are machine learning\\nrelated. This list includes HTTX, Starlette, FastAPI, Immutables,\\nPyodide, Modin, Streamlit, Transformers, Detectron2 and Metaflow. \\xa0\\n\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0 <a href=\"https://slideslive.com/neurips/\">NeurIPS 2019 Videos are\\nOut</a> Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) is a multi-track\\nmachine learning and computational neuroscience conference that includes\\ninvited talks, demonstrations, symposia and oral and poster\\npresentations of refereed papers.

It’s easy\\nto use, has widespread adoption, is open source, and integrates the\\nlatest language models. Ines Montani and Matthew Honnibal (core\\ndevelopers of spaCy and co-founders of Explosion) join the PracticalAI\\npodcast to discuss the history of the project, its capabilities, and the\\nlatest trends in NLP. They also dive into the practicalities of taking\\nNLP workflows to production. \\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0 <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/testing/\">Testing Guide for\\nSoftware</a> As software approaches production scale, it requires the\\nrelevant amount of testing on a component and system level. The\\napproaches involve when testing systems, especially in machine learning\\nbecome more ambiguous, and benefit from the best practices that have\\nbeen gathered. The testing guide in martin fowler’s blog is an excellent\\nand comprehensible source of information about testing, which can be\\nadopted not only for traditional software projects but also for machine\\nlearning / data science projects. \\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0 <a\\nhref=\"https://labs.spotify.com/2019/12/13/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/\">Spotify\\non Better ML Infrastructure</a> When Spotify launched people were amazed\\nthat they could access almost the world’s entire music catalog\\ninstantaneously. More users and more features led to more systems that\\nrelied on Machine Learning to scale inferences across a growing user\\nbase. As these ML systems were buildt, they started to hit a point where\\nengineers spent more of their time maintaining data and backend systems\\nin support of the ML-specific code than iterating on the model itself.\\nThey realized we needed to standardize best practices and build tooling\\nto bridge the gaps between data, backend, and ML. This blog post\\noutlines their experience building just that, and how they leverage\\nTensorflow Extended (TFX) and Kubeflow in their Paved Road for ML\\nsystems. \\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\xa0 OSS: <a\\nhref=\"https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/#data-science-notebook-frameworks\">Data\\nScience Notebooks</a> \\xa0 The theme for this week’s featured ML libraries\\nis <a\\nhref=\"https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning/#data-science-notebook-frameworks\">Data\\nScience Notebooks</a>.
